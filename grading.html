      Your code has a problem, 
      <br/>
     1. <i> const [isLoggedIn, setIsLoggedIn] = useState(false);
      <br />
      const handleLogin = () => {
        setIsLoggedIn(true);
      };
      <br/>
      const handleLogout = () => {
        setIsLoggedIn(false);
      };
     </i> 
     <br/>
     This state should not be handled in your App.js but rather in the component that has the logic for loging in and loging out. 
     To make this state change available app wide, you need to leverage the power of React's state management logic of either REDUX or CONTEXT API. 
     And then your App.js can access the values of isLoggedIn from app wide state everytime it renders. 

     <br/>
     <br/>
     2. <i>Login handleLogin={handleLogin} </i>
     <br/>
     You are calling your Login component in App.js and passing to it a prop with a name that is different from what is in the actual component. <i>handleLogin</i> is not the same as <i>onLogin</i>
     <br/>
     <i>function Login({ onLogin })</i>. 
     <br/>
     This is what I tried explaining to you. REACT is strict with the names of the props you are passing to components.
     But from point number one, that shouldn't have been handled from there in the first place.

     <br/>
     Because of this, I had to fix these bugs in your code from my machine just for you app to run. Please lookout for these bugs on your next project.
